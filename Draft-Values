## Values / Guiding Principles
We are a community committed to supporting each other to further research.
Support open source and open scholarship principles
Actors are working within and for the whole open source ecosystem, i.e. appreciation of context and own purposes within a greater whole, working towards the greater good
Open mind towards how to achieve best practices- everyone brings their most open mind to the table
We believe that the best open source for open science:
Involves end users throughout project development process
Reuses rather than replace whenever possible
### We believe that:
Research and scholarship is best done openly
Any incremental steps towards openness are valuable
Open source is people
Contributions aren’t just code. All contributions to open source and open science are valuable.  (Documentation, community, maintaining. Not sure these all not be articulated, but maybe a little better wording here.)
### Things we’re doing:
We exist to be greater than the sum of our parts and help and support each other
We develop and support community-driven open guidelines and standards of practice
We contribute to each others projects whenever possible, learn about other projects so that 
we can advocate for each others projects
We support each other’s work, and try to advocate for each other’s projects, including how other’s projects can be improved.
We actively work for equity and inclusivity
We work to amplify OS4OS projects so that they are more visible to the general public and advocated for.
We work with and build from the work of other open source and open science communities.
